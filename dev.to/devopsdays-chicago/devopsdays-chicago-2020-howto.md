# Virtual Event - How We Did It

Sept 1, 2020 was the 7th annual [DevOpsDays Chicago](https://devopsdays.org/chicago) conference. It was also the first time we did it virtually. It was super well-received, and a lot of folks have been asking me for details on our implmentation.

## The Program
stuff about why did we do one day, how did we pick the schedule, things we learned about breaks/lunch with time zones, and we fell into the trap of stil thinking of physical vs virtual

however talk about how we knew we didn't have to do "talks in the morning, open spaces in the afternoon" due to laws of physics thing

issue with speakers not knowing the proper length for talks (devopsdays talks usually 30 minutes, etc)

## Participant Experience

we did stuff for blah blah blah, 

### Discord Setup

#### Registration and Invite Link
used eventbrite, and shared the invite link that way in a few ways. We also put all the registrant emails into Mailchimp and sent a participant email to them all.

#### Code of Conduct 
used the mee6 bot, explain how this worked, etc

#### Channel setup for breakouts
how did people pick them? talk about the staging category, permissions, etc

### Moderator setup
push to talk, priority speaker, training, etc

### On-site vs virtual team
why did we do it this way blah blah blah


## Streaming of the talks
it was important for us that everyone could see the talks, even without registering, being on the platform, etc, so we did it all via youtube live. 

### Recording of the talks
why did we do pre-recorded, how did we do it (link to recording doc?)

fun benefit of the high quality recordings is that speakers now have a great recording of their talk!

theory of why not to do pre-recorded is more aspirational than in practice (riffing on other talks, etc). speakers are MORE likely to just "drop in" for their talk with virtual than physical, so optimizing for something that is unlikely to happen was not our choice.

### Fireside chats
discussion on why we did these, how did we do them (zoom, etc)

### AV costs
give a swag, not details, on our budget/costs

## Sponsors
experimenting with what it meant to be a sponsor, etc

### Sponsorship levels and benefits

### Sponsor channel setup
Note that we considered doing a "role" in Discord for this, but didn't, but we probably would in the future. 

### Sponsor onboarding

## Speaker experience

### Speaker comms

### Virtual speaker dinner

## Overall promo stuff/misc

### Participant training
the video matt recorded

### Yak promo video

### Interstitial videos
