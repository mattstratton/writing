# My AV setup for working/streaming at home

(title needs some work)

Given the change to complete remote work, especially for virtual conference presenting, etc, I decided to get myself really set up the way I liked it. This post just exists to go into detail on how I have things set up, for two reasons:

1. Share the setup in case anyone has something similar, and wants to know how I did certain things
2. Have a place to keep track of all my setup.

## Hardware
list all hardware stuff here

### Cameras

#### Canon M6 Mark II

this is the camera I prefer to use for recording/presenting, when looking the best matters! 

##### Accessories

- **Power adapter:** need a dummy battery, hard to get, blah blah blah

##### Settings

#### Logitech Brio

Not much to say here. Maybe talk about the Camera Settings app? Complain that there is no cask for the Logitech stuff.
